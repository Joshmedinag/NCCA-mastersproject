## Referencing note

Documentation pages establish implementation behaviour, but they do not
replace peer-reviewed related work. The thesis literature review should
critically compare format design, scene-linear imaging, render-pass workflows,
validation strategies, and pipeline reproducibility rather than presenting
this list without analysis.
