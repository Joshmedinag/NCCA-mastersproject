# Results Evidence

The repository retains historical screenshots showing the original prototype
working with real EXR files. The current interface is captured in
`website/assets/aovguard-current-ui.png`.

## Real Maya/Arnold multilayer result

File: `docs/images/01_real_maya_multilayer_result.png`

This historical screenshot shows a real multilayer EXR exported from Maya/Arnold
using Merge AOVs. Its manual mode selector and result layout belong to the
original prototype. The same file was subsequently validated with the current
automatic backend, which detects 25 channels and 8 AOV descriptors:

```text
beauty
Z
specular_direct
P
N
emission
diffuse_direct
albedo
```

`beauty`, `albedo`, `diffuse_direct`, `specular_direct`, and `emission` are
analysed as colour. `N` and `P` are recognised as vectors and `Z` as depth.
The `empty_aov` rule reports `emission`; the technical passes receive
per-channel diagnostics but are not subjected to colour luminance rules.

## Real simple EXR result

File: `docs/images/04_real_simple_exr_result.png`

This is also a historical screenshot from the earlier interface. In the current
backend, root RGB/RGBA channels are detected as a `beauty` colour AOV without a
manual mode selection.

## Large EXR note

The real multilayer EXR file is not included in the repository because it is too
large. These screenshots are retained as historical evidence and are not used
as evidence of the current UI design.

## Real EXR evaluation

The project does not generate or ship demonstration EXRs. Final correctness,
workflow and performance evidence should be captured with authorised real EXR
files representing the intended lighting and compositing workflow. Record each
file's renderer, resolution, channel structure and relevant expected result
without committing confidential production data.

Static report-format examples are retained under:

```text
docs/sample_reports/multilayer_report.json
docs/sample_reports/multilayer_report.html
```

These documents illustrate the JSON/HTML schema only. They should be replaced
or supplemented by anonymised reports from the final real-EXR evaluation.

## Automated verification

The source-intent and report-comparison update was verified locally on 13
August 2026 with 205 passing tests and 95.14% combined statement/branch coverage
on Python 3.12. The immediately preceding 190-test baseline had passed on both
Python 3.11 and 3.12. GitHub CI remains configured to enforce a 90% minimum
across Windows and Ubuntu for the supported Python versions. The suite includes
integration tests comparing canonical CLI and GUI payloads, explicit source
modes, robust series statistics, per-file finding evidence and JSON report
comparison.

## Frame-first benchmark

The reproducible 12-frame, 5-AOV benchmark reduced application-level reader
calls from 60 to 12 while preserving an identical pixel checksum. The recorded
median elapsed time on the test machine changed from 0.3255 seconds to 0.0800
seconds. See `docs/benchmark_results.md` for interpretation and limitations.
