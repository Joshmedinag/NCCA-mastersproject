# EXR Backend Spike Summary

This spike compares the candidate image backends for AOVGuard 2.0 without
adding a new production dependency.

## Scope

The experiment generates tiny float EXR fixtures and compares:

- OpenEXR
- OpenCV
- OpenImageIO, if importable

The script is intentionally a smoke benchmark rather than a final performance
benchmark. Timing values are useful for comparison during development, but they
are not statistically rigorous.

## Command

```powershell
uv --cache-dir .uv-cache run --python 3.12 --extra dev python experiments\exr_backend_spike.py
```

Optional OpenImageIO attempt:

```powershell
uv --cache-dir .uv-cache run --python 3.12 --extra dev --with OpenImageIO python experiments\exr_backend_spike.py --output-dir experiments\_spike_output_oiio
```

## Confirmed Results

### OpenEXR

OpenEXR is available in the current project environment.

Confirmed:

- reads EXR headers;
- exposes named channels;
- can read named RGB AOV channels such as `diffuse.R`, `diffuse.G`, `diffuse.B`;
- integrates with the new `build_file_inspection()` model;
- supports the MVP requirement for named-channel inspection and AOV extraction.

Observed version during the spike: `3.4.12`.

### OpenCV

OpenCV is available in the current project environment.

Confirmed:

- reads simple RGB EXRs as image arrays;
- loads RGB EXR data in BGR order;
- does not expose EXR named channels through `cv2.imread`;
- is not suitable as the primary backend for multilayer/named-AOV inspection.

Observed version during the spike: `4.13.0`.

### OpenImageIO

OpenImageIO was tested as an optional dependency using `uv --with OpenImageIO`.

Confirmed:

- the package can be downloaded and installed by `uv`;
- import fails in this Windows environment before any EXR read can occur.

Observed failure:

```text
ImportError: DLL load failed while importing OpenImageIO:
El nombre del archivo o la extension es demasiado largo.
```

The same import failure occurred when using a shorter temporary virtual
environment path:

```text
C:\Users\josha\Documents\Codex\oiio_spike_venv
```

## Preliminary Decision

OpenImageIO should **not** be added as a production dependency yet.

For the MVP, the safest backend path is:

1. use OpenEXR as the primary backend for structured EXR inspection and named
   channel reading;
2. keep OpenCV only as a simple-image fallback or compatibility path;
3. keep OpenImageIO as future work until the Windows import/DLL issue is
   understood and resolved.

## Generated Evidence

The spike writes JSON output to:

```text
experiments/_spike_output/backend_spike_results.json
experiments/_spike_output_oiio/backend_spike_results.json
experiments/_spike_output_oiio_shortenv/backend_spike_results.json
```

Generated EXR fixtures are not intended to be committed as source fixtures.
